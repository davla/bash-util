#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This script deals with manual installation of applications that aren't
# packaged in any repository. It assumes the machinery for manual installation
# to be installed.
#
# The script installs applications if they are not installed, or if the
# installed version is older than the latest available one. In this case, the
# current installation is wiped, and the new version is installed from scratch.
# Errors are logged in the log directory under the machinery installation path.
#
# Specific applications can be installed by passing their name, that is the
# name of the  *.inst file in the functions.d directory under the machinery
# installation path; other files matching the specifications can be used as
# well, by passing their absolute path. If no applications are provided, all
# the ones found in functions.d are installed.
#
# Arguments:
#   - -f: Flag, forces the installation of applications, regardless of the
#       installed version.
#   - $@: The applications to be installed, as names or absolute paths.
#       Optional, defaults to all the packages in functions.d. More info above.

# Arguments:
#   - $1: The command to be executed.
#   - $2: The application name. Used in the log file name and in the error
#       message.
#   - $3: The action to print in the error message.
